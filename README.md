# TicTacToe-with-simple-GUI
It's one of my first projects

This is a 3x3 advanced tic tac toe game.
Any move one the fields determines next move's location. As indicated by disabled fields. 
Players have to win on three fields inline or across, just like in normal tic tac toe game.
This code is very poorly writen. I didn't knew much about writing code then. 
This application works, but I don't recommend copy-pasting anything. 
This project can help you create your own tic tac toe game like this.
Ready to run .jar game file can be found in out\artifacts\TicTacToe_jar.
